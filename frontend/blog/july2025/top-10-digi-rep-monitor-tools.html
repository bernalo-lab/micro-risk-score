    <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm mb-6">Published: July 2025</p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      In an age where information spreads globally in seconds, monitoring your digital footprint is essential. Whether you‚Äôre a freelancer, executive, or growing brand, these tools help you stay informed and respond proactively to risks.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why Monitoring Matters</h2>

      Your digital footprint includes everything you publish and everything others say about you. A single negative article or viral post can damage years of credibility. By monitoring proactively, you can protect your reputation, respond to mentions, and strengthen trust.
