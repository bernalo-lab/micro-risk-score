    <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm mb-6">Published: July 2025</p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Your digital reputation is the collection of opinions, content, and experiences that shape how the world perceives you online. In an era where nearly every professional decision begins with a Google search, your online presence is as important as your CV or business credentials.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Why Your Digital Reputation is Critical</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      According to a 2024 Edelman Trust Barometer report, 79% of individuals and businesses are more likely to engage with someone who has a clear, positive online presence. From freelancers to large brands, your digital reputation impacts:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
      <li>Hiring and career opportunities</li>
      <li>Client acquisition and conversion rates</li>
      <li>Partnership and funding prospects</li>
      <li>Public trust and brand loyalty</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      A single negative review or outdated profile can undermine years of effort.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What Factors Shape Your Digital Reputation?</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Your reputation is built over time through every interaction, mention, and piece of content. Some of the most influential elements include:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
      <li>Reviews and ratings on Google, Trustpilot, and social platforms</li>
      <li>LinkedIn recommendations and endorsements</li>
      <li>Press mentions and articles about you or your business</li>
      <li>Your own published content (blog posts, videos, podcasts)</li>
      <li>Comments and engagement across platforms</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">How to Audit Your Digital Presence</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Begin with a comprehensive audit. Search your name or brand in incognito mode and note what appears on the first two pages of results. Evaluate:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
      <li>Is your information accurate and up to date?</li>
      <li>Are there any negative or misleading entries?</li>
      <li>Does your content reflect your expertise and values?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Tools such as <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts" class="text-blue-600 underline">Google Alerts</a>, <a href="https://mention.com" class="text-blue-600 underline">Mention</a>, and <a href="https://brand24.com" class="text-blue-600 underline">Brand24</a> can help you monitor new mentions in real time.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Examples of Reputation Success and Failure</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Consider Airbnb's success: they built trust by investing in user-generated reviews and clear safety policies. Meanwhile, companies that failed to respond to customer complaints publicly saw declines in revenue and engagement. Even individuals have faced lost job offers due to old, inappropriate posts resurfacing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Best Practices to Build a Positive Reputation</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      To build a reputation that supports your goals:
    </p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
      <li>Claim and complete profiles on all major platforms</li>
      <li>Post regularly to show consistency and engagement</li>
      <li>Respond to reviews and feedback professionally</li>
      <li>Showcase testimonials and case studies</li>
      <li>Use professional images and branding</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      If you‚Äôre a business, consider a dedicated page highlighting customer stories and media mentions.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">How to Respond to Negative Feedback</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Never ignore criticism. Responding shows accountability and transparency. Acknowledge the issue, apologise if necessary, and outline steps to resolve it. A tactful response can turn a critic into a supporter.
    </p>
