    <p class="text-gray-500 text-sm mb-6">Published: July 2025</p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Online reputation is no longer a side issue‚Äîit‚Äôs central to how customers perceive and engage with your business. Yet even experienced teams often make avoidable mistakes that damage credibility, reduce conversions and weaken customer loyalty.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      In this article, we‚Äôll explore the seven most common reputation management errors and how you can avoid them.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Mistake 1: Ignoring Reviews and Feedback</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      One of the biggest missteps is assuming you can simply ignore reviews‚Äîespecially negative ones. Customers expect businesses to respond. When they see no reply, they interpret silence as indifference.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Monitor all major review platforms. Aim to reply to every review within 48 hours. Thank customers for positive feedback and address criticism with professionalism and empathy.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Mistake 2: Being Defensive or Dismissing Complaints</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      It‚Äôs natural to feel frustrated by unfair criticism, but reacting emotionally only fuels the fire. Public arguments show prospective customers that you can‚Äôt handle feedback constructively.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Stay calm. Acknowledge the issue, apologise where appropriate, and offer a solution. Even if you disagree with the reviewer, remain courteous.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Mistake 3: Inconsistent Branding and Messaging</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      If your website, social media and directory listings show different addresses, opening hours or brand messages, customers lose confidence. Inconsistent information is a red flag.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Audit all online properties regularly. Use a brand style guide to maintain consistency across platforms.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Mistake 4: Failing to Collect Positive Reviews</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Many businesses are so busy putting out fires that they forget to proactively build positive reputation. This leaves your online presence unbalanced and dominated by a few loud critics.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Ask satisfied customers to share their experiences. Follow up after purchases or projects, making it easy to leave a review.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Mistake 5: Neglecting Social Media Engagement</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      An inactive or ignored social media page signals neglect. Customers expect timely responses and evidence that you‚Äôre listening.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Assign someone to monitor your social channels daily. Respond to questions and comments quickly, even if it‚Äôs just to acknowledge and follow up later.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Mistake 6: Not Monitoring Mentions Beyond Reviews</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Reputation isn‚Äôt built only in review platforms. Forums, blogs, and social conversations all shape public perception. Failing to monitor these spaces means you could miss damaging narratives.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Set up Google Alerts, use monitoring tools like Brand24, and check relevant hashtags regularly to stay informed.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Mistake 7: Lacking a Crisis Response Plan</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      When a PR crisis hits, time is critical. If your team doesn‚Äôt have a clear protocol, delays can make the problem worse and amplify negative coverage.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      <strong>How to fix it:</strong> Create a response plan outlining who handles communication, what channels to use and how to escalate issues internally.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Case Study: A Retailer‚Äôs Turnaround</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      A mid-sized retailer in Manchester saw sales decline after negative reviews about delivery delays. Initially, they ignored complaints, assuming the problem would fade. Instead, the reviews accumulated.
    </p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Finally, they implemented a structured response plan, acknowledged issues publicly and improved processes. Within three months, average review scores improved from 2.8 to 4.2 stars, and online conversions rebounded by 25%.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Key Takeaways</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Reputation management is an ongoing commitment, not a one-off project. By avoiding these common mistakes, you can build credibility, earn customer trust and maintain a positive brand image even during challenges.
