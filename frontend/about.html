    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      RiskPeek was created to bridge a growing gap in our digital world: the need for trust. Every day, people meet, transact, and build relationships online—often without meeting face to face. From hiring a remote freelancer to renting a property, we constantly ask ourselves, <em>"Can I trust this person or business?"</em>
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      Our mission is to empower honest individuals and businesses by giving them a simple, comprehensive way to showcase their reliability. RiskPeek combines identity verification, payment history, compliance checks, and online reputation into one clear risk score. We believe everyone deserves the tools to build trust and make confident decisions.

    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">Our Story</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
      RiskPeek was founded by a team with backgrounds in fintech, cybersecurity, and compliance. We noticed that traditional credit scores were only part of the picture—people's online reputations mattered too. So we developed an algorithm that blends financial and digital insights to help everyone understand and improve their trustworthiness.
